# ra1nsn0w

## Informatio

This is just my fork of ra1nsn0w that allows you to save the patched kernel to a file

It's added poorly and could be massively improved on but it works fine enough for me =p

May be helpful for those wishing to do tethered downgrades (as AMFI needs to be patched out of the kernel which ra1nsn0w can do), assuming you have a working ASR patch

To use just add "--kernel-save path/kernel.dump" to the arguments, with "path" being where you want to save the file. Note you *MUST* add a filename for ra1nsn0w to save the kernel to, not just a path!
